// Pseudocode:

HTML

- use HTML 5
- create file, include respsective scripts (jQuery in head)
- game title
- include div id
- like the HTML to the game.js file
- directions

JS

- create variable for array of crystal images (differnt types/colors)
  - crystals will need different, random values between 1 and 12 - crystal totals to be added to each total
  - images require a click function (using jQuery)
- console.log answers depending on the totals found

  - set a correct total answer #?? tba
  - winner message -- if the total number is reached
  - loser message
  - find a way to reset the game if the total number is not reached

  struggles:

  - figuring out a way to use the buttons with my div... tried organizing it differently, but am still left confused with what to do. i personally need more time getting acquainted with the material to understand where to go from here.
  - inability to find/locate the values between 1 and 12 that i had assigned the crystals in the console-- at all.
  - having trouble finding a way to get the totals of the values onto the html that is displayed

CSS

- have all crystal images on an even plane/ uniform look across the page across the page, same size.
- add a fun background look
- add CSS to the title

struggles:

- facing issues with how to style the crystals. trying to achieve pink borders and have them line up
